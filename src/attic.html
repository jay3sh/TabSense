<h2>TabSense Attic</h2>
<h3>What is Attic?</h3>
<p>Attic is a window which is a holding space for tabs. When you collapse a tab, all its child tabs disappear from the browser window. TabSense needs a place to hold them temporarily. When you expand the tab in future, TabSense will automatically move the child tabs from Attic to your browser window. You are not supposed to view them in this window.</p>
<h3>Why TabSense needs Attic?</h3>
<p>
Ideally the child tabs of collapsed nodes, should get invisible. However Google Chrome extension API so far doesn't provide any means to do that. Therefore TabSense uses a special window called 'Attic' to store those tabs temporarily.
